CHATGPT QUESTION:

You are a seasoned, expert data scientist.  I need your advice.  I have been asked to identify common themes among public comments submitted for a new proposed rule from my government agency.  We can receive thousands of individual comments from members of the public.  

I've already decided I'm going to have an LLM identify each theme in a comment string and create a 'short title or description' of each such theme.  This will simplify and distill down a raw comment into a set of 1+ 'one liner' descriptions that SHOULD be easier to cluster on (or at least that's my theory).

Next, my thought was to convert each short description into a word embedding and cluster each such resulting embedding using semantic similarity of the embeddings.  Now here's where I'm struggling and need your advice:

- I need an algorithmic means to identify the 'best' number of themes or clusters to create.  There is no way in advance to identify the number of such themes that might come in via these comment submissions from the public.  That said, any 'rule' the public is reacting to is for a bounded space (e.g.,, revising our agency's policies around a particular area), so logically the subjects of our comments (after filtering out irrelevancies, nonsense, etc.) is bounded as well -- put simply, the public can only reasonably say so many unique things or touch on so many unique subjects in response to a given rule.  So there will be a limit.  I need advice and sample Python code showing how I can algorithmically select the right number of clusters.

- I need to know the BEST open source package for clustering using word embeddings.  It may be an algorithm, etc., but I need pointers and sample code.  Again, I must use Python.  Also, I need to know any keep parameters or other tips when running this clustering.  Assume I have a list of theme strings for each comment already that I can word embed and then cluster via whatever code you produce.

- Any other tips you can suggest?





CHATGPT ANSWER:

Your approach to identifying themes within public comments using a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) for theme extraction and word embeddings for clustering is solid. Let’s break this down and I’ll give you some advice, code, and suggestions based on your needs.

1. Choosing the "Best" Number of Clusters

Identifying the optimal number of clusters, especially when dealing with word embeddings, can be tricky. There are several methods to help with this, but I'll focus on two popular and effective approaches:

A. Elbow Method

The Elbow Method is one of the most common ways to determine the optimal number of clusters. The idea is to plot the cost (in terms of distance between points and their centroids) against the number of clusters. The point where the cost starts to decrease more slowly (forming an "elbow") is typically the optimal number of clusters.

B. Silhouette Score

Silhouette Score measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates that the clusters are well-separated. This is another common method to assess clustering quality, and it can be used in conjunction with KMeans to determine the number of clusters.

Sample Code for Clustering and Choosing the Best Number of Clusters
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import spacy
import openai
import numpy as np

# 1. Convert each theme string into word embeddings using an LLM (or pre-trained embeddings).
# For example, we can use spaCy or OpenAI's embeddings.
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")  # spaCy model for word embeddings (you can use others if you prefer)

def get_embeddings(texts):
    return np.array([nlp(text).vector for text in texts])

# Example list of theme strings
themes = ["Economic impact", "Environmental sustainability", "Public health concerns", "Regulatory burden", "Community impact"]

# Convert themes to embeddings
embeddings = get_embeddings(themes)

# 2. Standardize the embeddings (important for many clustering algorithms)
scaler = StandardScaler()
embeddings_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(embeddings)

# 3. Determine the best number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

# Elbow Method
distortions = []
for k in range(2, 11):  # Test from 2 to 10 clusters
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(embeddings_scaled)
    distortions.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(range(2, 11), distortions, marker='o')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal k')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.ylabel('Distortion')
plt.show()

# Silhouette Score
sil_scores = []
for k in range(2, 11):  # Test from 2 to 10 clusters
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(embeddings_scaled)
    score = silhouette_score(embeddings_scaled, kmeans.labels_)
    sil_scores.append(score)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(range(2, 11), sil_scores, marker='o', color='r')
plt.title('Silhouette Score for Optimal k')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.ylabel('Silhouette Score')
plt.show()

# Choose the number of clusters that maximizes silhouette score or use the elbow method visually.
optimal_clusters = 3  # Example, adjust based on plot

# 4. Fit KMeans clustering with the optimal number of clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_clusters, random_state=42)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings_scaled)

# 5. Visualizing the clusters (using PCA for dimensionality reduction)
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_result = pca.fit_transform(embeddings_scaled)

plt.scatter(pca_result[:, 0], pca_result[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis', marker='o')
plt.title('PCA of Clusters')
plt.xlabel('PCA Component 1')
plt.ylabel('PCA Component 2')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()

# Print the theme strings with their assigned clusters
for i, theme in enumerate(themes):
    print(f"Theme: {theme}, Cluster: {labels[i]}")

Key Notes on Clustering:

KMeans: One of the most widely used clustering algorithms. It's fast and efficient, but its performance can depend on the initialization of centroids and number of clusters. You may want to experiment with KMeans++ initialization or MiniBatchKMeans for large datasets.

Silhouette Score: This metric is really useful for assessing the cohesion and separation of clusters. You can choose the number of clusters based on the highest silhouette score.

PCA for Visualization: You can reduce your high-dimensional embeddings to 2D or 3D for visualization (like in the last part of the code) to get a sense of how well the clusters are separating.

2. Best Open Source Package for Clustering with Word Embeddings

For clustering using word embeddings in Python, the following libraries are excellent:

scikit-learn: It has various clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) and dimensionality reduction tools (e.g., PCA, TSNE) that work well with word embeddings.

HDBSCAN: For non-parametric clustering, HDBSCAN is often superior to KMeans because it doesn’t require you to specify the number of clusters and it is very good at identifying noise. It’s great when your data is expected to have varying densities.

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): For high-dimensional data, UMAP can be used in conjunction with clustering to reduce dimensionality and produce more interpretable clusters. It works well with dense word embeddings.

Sample Code for HDBSCAN with Word Embeddings:

import hdbscan
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import spacy

# Load pre-trained word embeddings using spaCy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")

# Example theme strings
themes = ["Economic impact", "Environmental sustainability", "Public health concerns", "Regulatory burden", "Community impact"]

# Convert themes to embeddings
def get_embeddings(texts):
    return np.array([nlp(text).vector for text in texts])

embeddings = get_embeddings(themes)

# Standardize embeddings
scaler = StandardScaler()
embeddings_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(embeddings)

# Apply HDBSCAN clustering
clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=2, metric='euclidean')
labels = clusterer.fit_predict(embeddings_scaled)

# Print results
for i, theme in enumerate(themes):
    print(f"Theme: {theme}, Cluster: {labels[i]}")


Important HDBSCAN Parameters:

min_cluster_size: Minimum size of clusters. Adjust based on how granular you want the clusters to be.

metric: Metric to use for distance calculation (e.g., Euclidean).

cluster_selection_method: Choose between ‘eom’ (excess of mass) or ‘leaf’ for hierarchical clustering.

3. Other Tips

Preprocessing: Before clustering, clean your theme descriptions by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying lemmatization. You might also consider using TF-IDF vectorization as an alternative to word embeddings, depending on your data.

Embeddings Quality: If you don’t have access to a powerful LLM, using embeddings from models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or sentence-transformers might suffice. However, LLM-based embeddings (e.g., GPT-3/4, BERT) generally yield better quality and more semantic information.

Post-clustering analysis: After clustering, analyze the themes in each cluster to check for interpretability. If necessary, you can use techniques like topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify specific topics within each cluster.

Noise Filtering: Make sure to remove irrelevant themes or comments before embedding and clustering, as noise can affect the quality of your clusters. You can use simple keyword filtering or leverage pre-trained models to detect nonsense or off-topic comments.

This setup should provide you with a robust framework for clustering the themes from public comments. Let me know if you need further clarifications or additional adjustments to the code!
